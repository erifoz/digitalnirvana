The time when human brain is not powerful enough to fully keep up with innovation in its environment is here. One of the most fundamental 
problems on our journey to future society is going to be resolving the digital identity problem in such a way that will not
end up as the means for further control of minority societies.

nirvana project sets out to prove that digital identity is possible through cooperation instead of disruption.

key principles:

nirvana project is not monetized, there will be no ICO. Any future resources will be raised in bitcoin 
on decentralized crowdfunding platform.

all code and specification is created under free software license. contributors are not paid.

no partnership with any other project, open for cooperation with all.

mission objective:

nirvana mission will be completed when digital identity is implemented as a Proof of Concept and is publicly demonstrated.
This experiment shall create an architecture that will serve as valid and free option for consideration, shall any local authority that decides to implement
digital identity.
