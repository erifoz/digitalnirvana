Problem definition:

**Opportunity: >1b people do not have access to government-grade documentation (such as a passport) 
**Privacy: effectively controling your data on the internet need more skill/knowledge/time than average user has
**Freedom: problem of having corporations & banks developping this important architecture with limited user perspective

Goals definition:

**creating a proof of 'being human' - currently not possible on the internet (somehow solved by 'captcha' etc)
**creating a free protocol for implementation of digital identity
**provide a standard to generate multiple private pseudonymous identities
**provide a standard to Activate, Expire and Deactivate official identity
**propose a standard implementation of official identity on Bitcoin public ledger
**propose a system for creating one-way verifiable metadata
**propose a framework to integrate one-way verifiable metadata with local authority
**strictly separate private identities and official identity
