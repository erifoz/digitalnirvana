creating a proof of 'being human' - currently not possible on the internet (somehow solved by 'captcha' etc)

creating a free protocol for implementation of digital identities

provide a standard to generate multiple private pseudonymous identities

provide a standard to Activate, Expire and Deactivate official identity

propose a standard implementation of official identity on Bitcoin public ledger

propose a system for creating one-way verifiable metadata

propose a framework to integrate one-way verifiable metadata with local authority

strictly separate private identities and official identity

conduct extensive testing and attack vector analysis
