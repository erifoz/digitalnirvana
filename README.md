# digital nirvana
free, user-centric digital ID protocol with decentralized metadata referencing

Digital Identity is a pre-requisite for:
1. Decentralized, anonymous and trustless voting system
2. Universal Basic Income (UBI)
3. Universal Healthcare
4. Human verification (online proof of being a human) – define, later used “human proof”


Problem definition:

1. Opportunity: >1b people do not have access to government-grade documentation (such as a passport) 

2. Privacy: effectively controling your data on the internet need more skill/knowledge/time than average user has

3. Freedom: problem of having corporations & banks creating digital identity

Goals definition:

1. creating a proof of 'being human' - currently not possible on the internet (somehow solved by 'captcha' etc)

2. creating a free protocol for implementation of digital identities

3. provide a standard to generate multiple private pseudonymous identities

4. provide a standard to Activate, Expire and Deactivate official identity

5. propose a standard implementation of official identity on Bitcoin public ledger

6. propose a system for creating one-way verifiable metadata

7. propose a framework to integrate one-way verifiable metadata with local authority

8. strictly separate private identities and official identity

9. offer a standard for considering privacy towards biometric data

10. conduct extensive testing and attack vector analysis
