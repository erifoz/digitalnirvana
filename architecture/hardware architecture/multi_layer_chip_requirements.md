technology requirements:
RFID / NFC (likely a combination of the two)

Implementation:
no write access to chip after initialization of Layer B
physically owning the chip should not be helpful with identifying any of containing identities (either Layer A or Layer B)



for Proof of Concept, 2 separate layers are required

Layer A: 
storage requirements:
1 private key (1/2 multisig wallet as POC)
1 certificate
database of hashes of sha512 + references
proof of human transfer protocol script
authority communication protocol

software functions requirements:
Layer A creates a transfer message with proof of human (POC sha-512 result of part of private key and full certificate)
Layer A responds to requests received via authority communication protocol (POC 10 levels of reference hashes)
Layer A sends the transfer message to Layer B for initialization (POC script could self-destruct)

security requirements:
proof of human message cannot be stored on the chip after Layer B is initiated
authority communication protocol does not have access to all data
designed to make unauthorized read/write unfeasible (POC combination of Verification/validation/timestamp hashes)

implementation requirements:
Layer A does not store any personal data


Layer B:
storage requirements:
multiple private keys (POC : 10 privkeys of 1/2 multisig)
smartphone communication protocol layer ( 10 privkeys of 1/2 multisig)
Layer B initiation script
Chip lock script



software functions requirements:
Layer B initializes by transfer message generated by Layer A
Layer B Communicates with smartphone ia smartphone communication protocol
Layer B Exports references (POC sha-256 hash of sha-512 hash of unique identity reference + sha-512 hash of privatekey
Layer B executes Chip lock script that disables write access to the chip.
